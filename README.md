# Moist-Von-Lipwig
A pet project inspired from the character Moist Von Lipwig from Discworld, resembling the functionality of a time capsule, users will be able to send messages in different formats(text, audio, images .etc) to others and themselves, the catch being that the time of delivery is not known. So, one could send a message and recieve it the very next moment or ten years go by, they forget the message even exists and then only they get it. 

will SURELY deliver the message

## Motivation
the idea is to explore what communication looks like when immediacy is removed. instead of sending a message and expecting a followup immediately or in shor term at the very least, this is "send and wait without knowing".

---

## Non-goals
- this is not meant to replace instant messaging
- this is not meant to be efficient or optimized for speed
- this is not meant to be predictable

## uses if there are any
- users can send messages to their future selves. they won’t know when they will receive them, but delivery is guaranteed
- users can send messages to other people under the same conditions
